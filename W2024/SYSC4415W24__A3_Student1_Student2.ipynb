        "In this assignment, we are going to listen to some jazz and disco!\n",

        "The first model is your own **proposed model** (the exact same one you proposed in Part One). And the second model is the **pretrained model** you selected in Part One.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Instructions:\n",
        "**DO NOT** wait to the last minute to complete this assignment as it can take hours hours to do this assignment if you are unfmiliar with Python and Machine Learning libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "❗Your solutions must be self-contained in this notebook; no other supplementary material or files will be accepted. As soon as I open your assignment's notebook , I will click \"runtime\" → \"run all\". Ensure your notebook works properly without any errors and your results are clearly displayed, as instructed.\n",

        "You are provided with two datasets on Brightspace, to be used in Parts 1 & 2 of Assignment. Download the dataset of your choice (*Note that you must use the dataset that you selected in your proposal in Assignment 3 Part 1*), store it in your Google Drive (you need a gmail account to do this). It should be under your \"My Drive\" (After uploading it to your Google Drive, check the location by right clicking on the file *-> File Information -> Details -> Location*).  **Do not** put it into any sub-folder as  I won't be able to run your code. It will raise an error and you will lose marks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Metrics:**\n",
        "You must create a **confusion matrix** for each of the models you are implementing. A part of your assessment of this assignment is based on the language you use to *interpret what your confusion matrices are showing* and how you would *compare the performance of the two models* based on that.\n",

        "There are some question boxes in *markdown blocks* marked with (🎧🎸) emojis. Your answers to these question blocks should go on the *markdown blocks* marked with (📻🎹) emojis. Just double-click on the emoji and you can start typing.*Note that I will skip over any text answers that are within the code blocks.*\n",
        "\n",
        "**Libraries:** You can add any library you might need that is not already imported. *If you are using a library that needs to be installed on Colab, please provide the command for it in the specified code block in Section 1.1 Initializations.*\n",
        "\n",
        "**Optional steps:** There are some code blocks marked as optional. However, feel free to really show your work and add in as much extra info as you want. This may result in bonus points based on what you are doing.😉\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        " * It is optional to use cross-validation in this assignment, but you will get a bonus point for implementing it. 🎙️\n",

        " * It is optional to use a grid search to tune your hyperparameters for your own model, but you will get a bonus point for implementing it. 🎙️\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Runtime tips:** I suggest doing your coding and first making sure everything works fine on a CPU. Then do the actual model training on a GPU. To chage your runtime from CPU to GPU and vice versa, select **Runtime** -> **Change Runtime Type** -> under **Hardware accelerator** click on CPU or T4 GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Submission:** Submit your Notebook as a *.ipynb* file that adopts this naming convention: ***SYSC4415W24_A3_Student1_Student2.ipynb*** on *Brightspace*. No other submission (e.g., through email) will be accepted. (Example file name: SYSC4415W24_A3_ElmiraAmooei_AnthonyFuller.ipynb)\n",

        "### Grading:\n",
        "Considering the fact that Elmira is really generous with marking and she wants to see if you understand the point of data exploration, pretraining, confusion matrix, etc., she is very strict with plagiarism. Therefore, for the text answers, she will not show mercy with **suspicious** cases and they will be sent to the Associate Dean for investigation. However, it is alright if you need to consult with Chat-GPT/online resources to figure out **some parts of the code**. Although, remember that I will see a huge ton of submissions that look identical and you might get unlucky! ☠️\n",
        "\n",
